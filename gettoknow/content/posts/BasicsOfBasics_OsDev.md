# Introduction:
	In a journey to understand how Operating systems works, I'll do an attempt of making a minimalistic operating system called YonaOS it's will be available in GITHUB where you can clone, learn, and give feedback, I should warn you that this code and the concepts may not be perfectly correct/explained, and your feedback is what will improve it, do not hasitate to contact me :)
	This is the first blog that will discuss the main steps I followed to have it at this state. And also provide All resources I've used.

## STEPS:
- ### [Building a Cross-Compiler]({{< ref "GccCrossCompiler.md" >}})
- ### [Needed Knowledge to Procceed !!]({{< ref "OsDevKnowledge.md" >}})
- ### [Boot Sector]({{< ref "BootSector.md" >}})
- ### [Real Mode]({{< ref "16BitMode.md" >}})
- ### [Protected Mode]({{< ref "32BitMode.md" >}})
